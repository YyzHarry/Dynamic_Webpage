# Dynamic Webpages

## Introduction
This is a dynamic webpage that presents our collecting-datas timely in one of my research named ___3D-AQImaps Building by UAV Sensing___.

It consists of client, server and database. ~~Somehow it's not copmplete because I'M STILL WORKING ON IT...~~

## Client
> The client is implemented by HTML/CSS and javascript. Of course we use _Bootstrap_ and _jQuery_ to simplify the process.

## Server
> The server is coded by Node.js and Express. 

## Database
> The database I use is MySQL. It's easy and free to establish your databases through MySQL. 

## Usage
1. Run your __xx.sql__ file to establish your databases. Notice that you should first add your contents into your databases/tables.
```SQL
$ source *your filepath*.sql
```
* Start your server realized by Node.js.
```javascript
$ node server.js
```
