# Dynamic Webpages

## Introduction
<!--
This is a dynamic webpage that presents our collecting-datas timely in one of my research named ___3D-AQImaps Building by UAV Sensing___.
-->
This is a dynamic webpage that presents the realtime AQI maps of Peking University, including both 3D (3-dimentional) and 2D (2-dimentional).

The project now serves as a demo for a junior course __Computer Networking__.

It consists of client, server and database.  ~~Somehow it's not complete because I'M STILL WORKING ON IT...~~

## Client
The client is implemented by HTML/CSS and javascript. We use _Bootstrap_ and _jQuery_ to simplify the process.

## Server
The server is coded by Node.js and Express, as well as Python.

__Update__: We add ___Python___ files to real-timely scrape AQI data from _Moji_.

## Database
The database I use is MySQL. It's easy and free to establish your databases through MySQL. 

## Usage
* Run your __xx.sql__ file to establish your databases. Notice that you should first add your contents into your databases/tables.
```SQL
$ source *your filepath*.sql
```
* Start your server realized by Node.js.
```javascript
$ node server.js
```
